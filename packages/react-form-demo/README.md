# React Form Handling

This challenge starts with a form powered entirely by React (and webpack) and offers some suggestions for practicing React with interaction.

## Setup

### 0. Cloning and installation
- [ ] Clone this repo, navigate to it, install packages, and start the server with `npm start`
  <details style="padding-left: 2em">
    <summary>Tip</summary>

    ```sh
    cd react-form-demo
    npm i
    npm start
    ```
  </details>

- [ ] Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser
  <details style="padding-left: 2em">
    <summary>More about the app in its starting state</summary>

    You'll see it contains a relatively complex form with validation and editing using controlled components.
  </details>

## Stretch

### 1. Things to try

- Add a bunch more text fields
- Try adding more form elements that control appearance, for example:
  - a checkbox that 'features' the item in the list by highlighting it
  - a slider for color opacity
  - radio buttons for "will explode", "won't explode", "may explode (we're not sure)", etc
- If you're feeling ambitious, add a file upload component!
