# TODO App

For this challenge, we will build a todo app (which is a common way to practice a new technology), using the full stack! From the database to the server, the API client, React and Redux, this app will ask you to use everything you've learned.

## Setup

### 0. Cloning and installation
- [ ] Clone this repo, navigate to it, install packages, and start the server with `npm run dev`

    You may also want to start a new branch
    ```sh
    cd todo-full-stack
    npm i
    git checkout -b <branchname>
    npm run dev
    ```

- [ ] See the designs [here](http://localhost:3000/designs/)

  - When running knex, run `npm run knex <command>`, e.g. `npm run knex migrate:latest` rather than using `npx`
  - When running webpack, run `npm run webpack <extra commands>`, e.g. `npm run webpack`, rather than using `npx`

## Requirements

Here's a list of steps in case they are useful. You can build in any order you like though ;)

### 1. Building the database

- [ ] Design a database to store a list of tasks, e.g. task details, priority, completed yes/no
- [ ] Build the migrations and seed data

### 2. Building the API
- [ ] Build an API (back end route) to get the information from your database (list, add, update and delete)
- [ ] Test your API with Insomnia

## Front end

### 3. Setting the stage

- [ ] Build a React component with static html
- [ ] Design Redux global state (think of it like a JS object)
- [ ] Build Redux reducers (the properties or keys of your state design are reducers, the values are hard-code static data as initialState)

## 4. Building the API client
- [ ] Build API client in the front end

### 6. Building thunky actions
- [ ] Build Thunk actions to get task from the API
- [ ] Build Redux actions to save task data from the API (remove hard-code initialState)

## Stretch

  - Forms can be tough to build accessibly. First ensure all parts of your form can be reached and used with keyboard-only navigation. Then test your form page with the WAVE browser extension, and fix any accessibility issues it detects
