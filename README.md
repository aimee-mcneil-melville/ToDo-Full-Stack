## Sendgrid

Email notifications are being sent via https://sendgrid.com/ from the address admin@gardenz.eda.nz

In order to change the template log in (as a team member) to Don's/EDA account and select 'Email API' from the side panel and then 'Dynamic templates'

The template is called 'newEvent' and utilises handlebars to display personalised data.

The email template id is also referenced here and currently has the id 'd-5f8909decdc94fa08d818b740e47a025' which needs to be referenced in the notifications.js file (in server/notifications folder).

Within the notifications.js file personalised data is contained within the 'dynamic_template_data' object.

To change the volunteer button in the template, select the button and the url will display on the left hand side of the screen. The url will have to change if testing the volunteer link on localhost or once it has been deployed.
